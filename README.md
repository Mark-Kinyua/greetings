# A Go Module

A Go Module hosted on github that can be imported by other scripts to return a greetings message.
It allows for multiple requests, add support for getting greetings for multiple people in one request. In other words, you'll handle a multiple-value input, then pair values in that input with a multiple-value output. To do this, you'll need to pass a set of names to a function that can return a greeting for each of them.
